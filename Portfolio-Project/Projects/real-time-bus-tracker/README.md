# Real Time Bus Tracker Exercise
## Description:
This project, as it name tells, is a real time bus tracker 1.01. 
The data will be taken from Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, which is going to be updated every 7.5 seconds.
In the exercise, it will only be tracked the route of bus 1 which travels between MIT campus, and harvests, Harvard's Campus.
In the screen, it will be displayed a map from mapboxgl with a zoom in the route mentioned, and the bus trackers.

## How to run?
The only thing that you have to do to run this project is open the site.
Project is self runned as it update the buses location automatically.

## Further Improvements:
### Short Term

Launch applications for non-developed countries. 
Make an interactive app to recommend the user its best bus route to go from a place to another at that moment.
