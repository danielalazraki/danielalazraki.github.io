# Eyes Exercise
## Description:
This exercise displays two eyes in the screen that follow the mass movement.
This would be like just like a person following the mass movement, but the mass in this case is the mouse.
It is a very simple project of JS, HTML and CSS to manipulate the DOM with the onmousemove JS function.

## How to run?
It is a very simple project, once the document is open, you just have to move the mouse around the screen to run it and watch how the eyes follow the mass movement.

## Further Improvements
### Short Term
Make a whole face. 
### Long Term
Develop a funny educative website for kids, so they are able to learn dynamically about faces.
